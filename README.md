# UOTSCS-Assignment5-Workday-Scheduler

The Workday Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows a user to 
save tasks for each hour of the workday. The current date and time of day is 
displayed at the top of the page. The hourly time blocks are color coded
to reflect if the time block is in the past, the present or the future in relation 
to the current time of day to help with time management. The tasks will be retained 
upon a page refresh.
